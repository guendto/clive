            clive installation

 Normally you can do "make" and then "make install". That will first check for
 the required Perl modules and then install the clive in your own ~/bin/
 directory. If you want to do a global install, you can do (as root):
    # make prefix=/usr install

 The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:
    # make WITH_MAN=no install

 When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:
    # make prefix=/usr uninstall

 Developers may also find the following make target useful:
    man # generate clive.1 from clive (req. pod2man)


            clive prerequisites

 * Perl >= 5.8

 Perl modules:
 * Config::Tiny (2.12+)
 * WWW::Curl (4.05+)
 * HTML::TokeParser (2.37+)
 * URI::Escape (3.29+)
 * Digest::SHA (5.47+)

 Optional Perl modules:
 * BerkeleyDB (0.34+) # Cache features, e.g. --show, --grep 
 * Clipboard (0.09+)  # --paste from X clipboard
 * IO::Pager (0.05+)  # --show; same as running "clive --show | less"
 * Expect (1.21+)     # --clivepass
 * Term::ReadKey      # SIGWINCH: resize progressbar to match terminal width

 clive runs without the optional modules but the specified program features
 will be disabled if the required module is not found.

 Most Unix/Linux distros have made the above Perl modules available as
 packages but you can also install them from CPAN, e.g.:
   # cpan install $modulename


            Getting started
