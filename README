GETTING STARTED
===============

Read the manual. The FAQ is available at <http://clive.sourceforge.net/>.

For the impatient:

 cat > ~/.cliverc
 --quvi "/usr/bin/quvi %u"
 --get-with "/usr/bin/curl -L -C - -o %f %u"

clive will attempt to detect those commands from the $PATH by default,
unless you define the above two. The above steps are recommended.

If you use an HTTP proxy, refer to the documentation of those commands.
