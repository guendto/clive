2.3.0

This release makes clive more simple, modular and flexible. Instead of re-
inventing the wheel over and over again, we now leave much of the heavy-
lifting for other tools to do. In a sense, clive is now a glorified wrapper
script with a few fancy tricks in the sleeve.

    * single-script vs. multiple-clive-modules
        - Easier deployment and updating

    * clive no longer, directly, fetches and parses video details
        - quvi(1) <http://quvi.googlecode.com/> does this for us now

    * clive no longer downloads the videos
        - This is left for an external command to do (e.g. curl or wget)

    * Some of the more esoteric features were discarded
        - See the full list below

    * Fewer prerequisites

    * Additional bonus: faster response time

NOTES

    * If you installed clive 2.3 beta 1, you can remove WWW::Quvi from
        your system, we no longer use it

    * --format no longer supports the arcane IDs (e.g. 'mp4')

Version 2.2.15

Changes to --format

  * "flv" is now called "default"

Youtube:

  * Add HD 1080p support

  * Add support for the quvi supported Youtube IDs (e.g. sd_270p).
    The old (and vague) IDs (e.g. mp4 or hd) are still supported
    but should be considered _deprecated_.


Version 2.2.9

cctv support was fixed. These videos appear to come in (at least) two
flavors now: multi-segment and single-segment. The issue has been
discussed here:
  http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=45

It was decided, mainly due to overall laziness, that multi-segment
video links are to be dumped to the terminal without any further
fiddling with them. The reasons have also been covered in the above
discussion.
