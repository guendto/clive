PREREQUISITES

See the Makefile.PL file.

INSTALLATION

You can skip this step, if you like, and instead just run ./bin/clive .
This should work as long as the prerequisite modules have been installed
to your system (see above).

If you choose to install:

    * Highly recommended
        - Remove / uninstall any earlier version you have installed

    * You can specify install prefix with INSTALL_BASE
        e.g. perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

To install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
