            clive installation

 Normally you can do "make" and then "make install". That will first check for
 the required Perl modules and then install the clive in your own ~/bin/
 directory. If you want to do a global install, you can do (as root):

    # make prefix=/usr install

 The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

    # make WITH_MAN=no install

 When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

    # make prefix=/usr uninstall

 Developers may also find the following make target useful:

    man # generate clive.1 from clive (req. pod2man)


            clive prerequisites

 Optionally (clive runs without them but some features will be disabled):
