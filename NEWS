2.3.0  "Glorified Wrapper Script" (2.3_gws)

* Single-script vs. multiple-clive-modules
    - clive is no longer dispersed all over the file system in Perl packages

* Use quvi(1) to parse the video details
    - 2.3 was going to use WWW::Quvi and libquvi (beta 1)
    - Had a piffany (beta 2)

* Leave downloading for an external 3rd party command to do
    - e.g. curl, wget or whatever

* Complete command line interface clean up
    - Esoteric, or otherwise now completely obsoleted, features were discarded

Version 2.2.15

Changes to --format

  * "flv" is now called "default"

Youtube:

  * Add HD 1080p support

  * Add support for the quvi supported Youtube IDs (e.g. sd_270p).
    The old (and vague) IDs (e.g. mp4 or hd) are still supported
    but should be considered _deprecated_.


Version 2.2.9

cctv support was fixed. These videos appear to come in (at least) two
flavors now: multi-segment and single-segment. The issue has been
discussed here:
  http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=45

It was decided, mainly due to overall laziness, that multi-segment
video links are to be dumped to the terminal without any further
fiddling with them. The reasons have also been covered in the above
discussion.
