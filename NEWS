2.3.0  "Glorified Wrapper Script" (gws)

* Single-script vs. multiple-clive-modules
    - clive is no longer dispersed all over the file system in Perl packages

* Use quvi(1) to parse the video details
    - 2.3 was going to use WWW::Quvi and libquvi (beta 1)
    - Had a piffany (beta 2)

* Leave downloading for an external 3rd party command to do
    - e.g. curl, wget or whatever

* Complete command line interface clean up
    - Esoteric, or otherwise now completely obsoleted, features were discarded
    - Run clive with --help to see what's left, or see "REMOVED" below

NOTES
    * If you installed clive 2.3 beta 1, you can remove WWW::Quvi from
        your system, we no longer use it

REMOVED
    * --cache-*, rendered largely obsolete due to one-time-use-URLs
    * --emit-csv, use quvi(1) instead, it supports JSON, XML, etc.
    * --stream-*, use quvi(1) instead, it has --exec (as of 0.2.7)
    * --hosts, run quvi(1) with --support
    * --cclass, replaced by --regexp
    * --connect-timeout-socks
    * --exec-run, use --exec
    * --upgrade-config
    * --print-fname
    * --cookie-jar
    * --stop-after
    * --limit-rate
    * --last-file
    * --overwrite
    * --continue
    * --no-proxy
    * --stderr
    * --debug
    * --proxy
    * --agent
    * --last

RENAMED
    * --no-extract -> --no-download

NEW
    * Support for additional config search paths (e.g. system wide)
    * Support for CLIVE_CONFIG env. setting
    * --config-file
    * --get-with
    * --regexp
    * --quvi

OTHER
    * --format arg value is no longer checked
    * --format no longer supports the arcane IDs (e.g. 'mp4')

See Makefile.PL for the updated prerequisites.


Version 2.2.15

Changes to --format

  * "flv" is now called "default"

Youtube:

  * Add HD 1080p support

  * Add support for the quvi supported Youtube IDs (e.g. sd_270p).
    The old (and vague) IDs (e.g. mp4 or hd) are still supported
    but should be considered _deprecated_.


Version 2.2.9

cctv support was fixed. These videos appear to come in (at least) two
flavors now: multi-segment and single-segment. The issue has been
discussed here:
  http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=45

It was decided, mainly due to overall laziness, that multi-segment
video links are to be dumped to the terminal without any further
fiddling with them. The reasons have also been covered in the above
discussion.
