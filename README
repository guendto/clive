README for clive
----------------

clive is a command line utility for extracting videos from Youtube and other
video-sharing websites. It was written to bypass the Adobe Flash requirement
to view the hosted videos. See http://clive.sf.net for more information
on clive.


Prerequisites
-------------

See Makefile.PL file.


Optional modules
----------------

* BerkeleyDB
  - If not installed, clive cache features will be disabled

* Term::ReadKey
  - If not installed, clive will not resize progressbar to
  match terminal width


Installation
------------

    perl Makefile.PL

INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your module
will be installed. INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone else calls
"prefix" than PREFIX is. For example:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~

    make
    make test
    make install

NOTE: "make test" will not run the host specific test cases unless
you set CLIVE_TEST_HOSTS env. variable. Please note that these
tests run clive executable which will use ~/.cliverc settings
if they can be found.
