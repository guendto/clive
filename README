README for clive
----------------

clive is a command line utility for extracting videos from Youtube and other
video-sharing websites. It was written to bypass the Adobe Flash requirement
to view the hosted videos. See http://clive.sf.net for more information
on clive.


Prerequisites
-------------

See Makefile.PL file.


Optional modules
----------------

* BerkeleyDB
  - If not installed, clive cache features will be disabled

* Term::ReadKey
  - If not installed, clive will not resize progressbar to
  match terminal width


Installation
------------

INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where clive will
be installed. For example:

  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

NOTE: "make test" will not run the host specific test cases unless you
set CLIVE_TEST_HOSTS env. variable. Note that if you have ~/.cliverc
installed, clive will use it.
