            clive installation

 Normally you can do "make" and then "make install. That will first check for
 the required Perl modules and then install the clive in your own ~/bin/
 directory. If you want to do a global install, you can do (as root):

    # make prefix=/usr install

 The manual page is installed by default, if you do not need it:

    # make WITH_MAN=no install

 When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

    # make prefix=/usr uninstall

 Developers may also find the following make target useful:

    man # generate clive.1 from clive (req. pod2man)


            clive prerequisites

 - Perl >= 5.8
 - Config::Tiny (2.12+)
 - WWW::Curl (4.05+)
 - HTML::TokeParser (2.37+)
 - BerkeleyDB (0.34+)
 - URI::Escape (3.29+)
 - XML::Simple (2.18+)

 Optionally (clive runs without but some features will be disabled):
 - Clipboard (0.09+) # --paste
 - IO::Pager (0.05+) # --show
 - Expect (1.21+)    # --clivepass

 Note that you can install these modules from CPAN, typically (as root):

   # cpan install $modulename

 Although many distros have made them available as packages.


            Getting started with clive

 Typical use:

    % clive "http://youtube.com/watch?v=3HD220e0bx4"

 Be sure to read the manual page which can also be accessed with:

    % clive --manual

 See also the ./configrc file.


            Installation: FreeBSD

 Global installation (as root):

    # gmake prefix=/usr/local mandir=/usr/local/man install

 From the Ports:
 * lang/perl5.8
 * databases/p5-BerkeleyDB

 * security/p5-Digest-SHA
 * devel/p5-Config-Tiny
 * www/p5-HTML-Parser

 Optional:
 * devel/p5-IO-Pager

 WWW::Curl (www/p5-WWW-Curl) module is outdated (3.02) in the Ports
 at the time of writing this. There are currently two ways to work
 around this:

  1) Patch www/p5-WWW-Curl to 4.05 # For the adventurous

    # cd /usr/ports/www/p5-WWW-Curl
      (backing up this directory is recommended)
    # fetch \
        "http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?prp=125323-1-txt&n=/patch.txt"
    # patch -p1 < patch.txt
    # make install clean

  2) Install from CPAN.

    # cpan install WWW::Curl

    You may want to install these modules from the Ports
    *before* running the above command:
