2.3

clive now uses libquvi [1], through WWW::Quvi [2], to parse the video details.

New:
    * --regexp, this was copied from cclive
    * --transfer-timeout
    * --dns-cache-timeout

Removed:
    * --upgrade-config
    * --last
    * --last-file
    * --stderr
    * --print-fname
    * --cookie-jar
    * --cache-* [3]
    * --connect-timeout-socks
    * --stop-after
    * --emit-csv, use quvi(1) instead, it supports JSON, XML, etc.
    * --stream-*, use quvi(1) instead, it has --exec (as of 0.2.7)
    * --cclass, use --regexp instead
    * --exec-run, use --exec instead

Open a ticket if you think anything above deserves to be backported to 2.3.

Renamed:
    * --hosts       -> --support
    * --debug       -> --verbose-libcurl
    * --no-extract  -> --no-download
    * --limit-rate  -> --throttle

Other:
    * Exit status changes 0=OK, 1=failure
    * --format arg value is no longer checked
    * --format no longer supports the arcane IDs (e.g. 'mp4')
        - I think we can all agree the libquvi provided IDs are less confusing
    * Status message and progressbar changes

See Makefile.PL for the updated prerequisites.

[3] Caching is a thing of the past, most websites have started to
    use "expiring" video links, rendering this feature obsolete.



Version 2.2.15

Changes to --format

  * "flv" is now called "default"

Youtube:

  * Add HD 1080p support

  * Add support for the quvi supported Youtube IDs (e.g. sd_270p).
    The old (and vague) IDs (e.g. mp4 or hd) are still supported
    but should be considered _deprecated_.


Version 2.2.9

cctv support was fixed. These videos appear to come in (at least) two
flavors now: multi-segment and single-segment. The issue has been
discussed here:
  http://code.google.com/p/clive/issues/detail?id=45

It was decided, mainly due to overall laziness, that multi-segment
video links are to be dumped to the terminal without any further
fiddling with them. The reasons have also been covered in the above
discussion.
