PREREQUISITES

See the Makefile.PL file for Perl module prerequisites, under "PREREQ_PM".
Additionally, you will need:
  * quvi [1], 0.2.17+
  * Download command, e.g. curl [2] or wget [2], etc.

[1] <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>
[2] <http://curl.haxx.se/>
[3] <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>


INSTALLATION

You could skip this step, if you like, and instead just run "bin/clive".
This should work as long as the prerequisites are found.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

You can specify the install prefix with INSTALL_BASE
e.g. "perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local"

GETTING STARTED

Read "man clive" (or "perldoc man1/clive.1.pod"). You should consider
setting --quvi and --get-with in your config file for seamless use.
For example:

% cat > ~/.cliverc
--quvi "/usr/bin/quvi %u"
--get-with "/usr/bin/curl -L -C - -o %f %u"

If you need to set HTTP proxy, etc., please refer to the documentation
of those commands.


NOTES FOR PACKAGERS

Consider packaging a system-wide default configuration file along with
your clive package. The config file should define at least --quvi and
--get-with (see "GETTING STARTED" above) so that clive will work
"out-of-the-box" when your package is installed.

You could use wget(1) instead of curl(1), although I am yet to find
the correct combo of options that allows resuming file transfers
without overwriting the existing file (e.g. "wget -c -O %f" does not
yield the hoped results).

Whatever values you choose to set in the default system-wide config
file, please be sure to make your clive package depend on those
commands/packages.

For additional notes about the configuration file (e.g. paths), please
read the "FILES" section in the manual page.
    % perldoc man1/clive.1.pod

For an example config file, please see also examples/cliverc.
